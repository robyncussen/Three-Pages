 <li>1.Preferred name
My name is Robyn! But I am affectionately called Bean by my friends</li>
<li> 2.Favourite Travel Destination (or) Dream Travel Destination?
I have an in motion Iceland/Ireland/Scotland trip with my sister, but I would also LOVE to travel to Oregon, San Francisco, the PNW has my whole heart - as well as all over Europe! However my fav place to travel back to time and time again is  my second home, beautiful British Columbia </li>
<li> 3. Favourite TV Show / Movie?
Right now in terms of TV shows I’m obsessed with See (Apple TV original), Wheel of Time, Stranger Things, Law&Order SVU, Criminal Minds, Lost, GOT, CSI, Fate: the Winx club, and I’m excited for the new game of thrones TV  and LoTR TV show coming out!
Movie wise I love horror! My fav movies include Alien (whole trilogy), Lord of the rings, Harry Potter (duh), as well as my OG comfort trilogy The Mummy!</li>
<li> 4.  Favourite Type of Music / Artists?
Anything! But I’m in love with City & Colour, Mumford and Sons, Hozier, Florida Georgia Line, Russ, and my golden oldies like the Styx, U2, Shania Twain, Bryan Adam’s, etc! </li>
<li>5. Favourite Food / Restaurant? 
Potatoes always and forever! Perfect for every meal! Also an old person at heart so I love soup.</li>
<li>6. Favourite Hobbies?
I love to thrift! I’m also an avid reader, I would live in chapters if I could. I also really like crafting, I like pottery, painting, things like that and I’d really love to start hobby gardening!</li>
<li>7. Favourite Sports (or Sports Teams)?
Go Leafs go! TML fan till the day I die, just like my dad raise me! </li>
<li>8. Animal I relate to most:
Possums, because truly I am just an odd looking marsupial trying to get through the day.</li>
<li>9. Most quoted line:
“Not today Satan” why? Perfect for every situation. Someone being mean to you? Minor inconvenience? Coffee burnt your tongue? Boom, not today Satan.</li>
<li> 10. Hot take:
The popcorn jelly belly is absolutely disgusting and if you like it you deserve jail time. </li>
